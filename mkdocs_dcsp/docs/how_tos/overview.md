# Overview

## Structure of clinical safety documentation
Each instance of clincal safety documenation on DCSP is treated as a 'Project'.
A project may or may not have source code. Within each project you will find
a single set of safety 'Documents'. These safety documents are build from
'Templates' written in markdown. Each usage of a template is termed
an 'Entry'. This can be viewed as follows:

Project -> Documents -> Templates -> Entry

## Minimum files
* An `index.md` in the `docs` folder
