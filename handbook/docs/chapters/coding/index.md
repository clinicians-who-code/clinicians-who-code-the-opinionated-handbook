# Terminology, classification and code systems

## Terminology
A **terminology** is a body of terms (concepts) used within a particular subject of study or profession. 

## Classification
A **classification** is a systematic organisation of things into classes. A classification system such as ICD-10 cannot be used as a terminology and many terminologies cannot be easily used as a classification system. This is an important distinction and relates to the how those data are primarily used.

## Ontology
An **ontology** is the subject of studying the relationships between objects.

* Differences between terminology and classification

* Use of terminology and binding within information models such as HL7 FHIR and openEHR
* Mapping between SNOMED and classification systems such as ICD-10 and OPCS

* The UK national terminology server
