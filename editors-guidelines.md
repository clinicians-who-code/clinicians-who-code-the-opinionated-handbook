# Editor Guidelines
By Mark Bailey

## Introduction
Outlined here are some basic guidelines on how best we can work together to build the `Clinicians who code - The Opinionated Handbook`. These are not set in stone and so we can adapt them to help streamline processes.

## Layout of topics
All of the topics we write will be in the chapters folder, with subsequent subfolders as needed. Please keep all names of file and folders in lower case and use kebab-style-case.

We will need to decide as some point the order of the chapters in this index file, perhaps depend on topic difficulty (for example if someone was trying to learn about clinical informatics and wanted to read the book from start to finish).

## Writing styles
We will be using markdown and its syntax for this handbook. Please see the [example](chapters/example/example.md) for an example of the style.
